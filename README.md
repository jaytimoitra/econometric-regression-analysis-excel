# Econometric Regression Analysis using Microsoft Excel

## Project Type
Academic / Econometrics Project

## Objective
To examine the relationship between selected independent variables and multiple dependent variables using regression analysis, and to observe how estimated coefficients behave across repeated model specifications.

## Description
This project involves running multiple linear regression models using Microsoft Excel’s Data Analysis ToolPak.
A common set of independent variables is used across multiple dependent variables (Y1–Y50), and regression outputs are compared to study coefficient stability and variation.

Each worksheet represents the output of one regression model, while a summary sheet provides interpretation and key observations.

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel
- Data Analysis ToolPak (Regression)

## Key Learnings
- Application of multiple linear regression
- Interpretation of regression coefficients
- Role of control variables
- Understanding random error terms in regression models
- Comparative analysis across multiple model specifications
## Note
The analysis is based on simulated data and is intended for academic learning purposes.
